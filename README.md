FEWD assignment 1

## Introductions  
Hello! My name is **David**.  
#### Three things I like to do are: 
* *hike* 
* *listen to music*  
* *drink coffee*  

I was able to do all three on a recent trip to Northwest Arkansas to visit family. I took a two hour walking tour of ***Cosmic Caverns***, Arkansas' largest privately owned cave. I was also very excited to visit the recently opened [The Bob Dylan Center](https://bobdylancenter.com) in Tulsa, Oklahoma. The center is the main public venue for the [Bob Dylan Archive](https://bobdylancenter.com/archive/) collection, which contains over 100,000 items.  There are many wonderful coffee shops and roasters in the area. My favorite is [Onyx Coffee Lab](https://onyxcoffeelab.com/pages/rogers) in Rogers, Arkansas.

##### The Bob Dylan Center  
As soon as I learned about the center opening in May 2022 adjacent to the Woody Guthrie Center, I started to think about visiting. One of my favorite albums, which I have liked since I was a teenager, is *Highway 61 Revisted*. A highlight of my visit was listening to the jukebox curated by Elvis Costello. He chose 162 songs from Dylan, artist who influenced him, and artists who he influenced. Some of my favorite musicians are on the jukebox, including The Beatles, Nina Simone, Chuck Berry, Dolly Parton,and Frank Sinatra.
